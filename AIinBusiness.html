                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    Artificial Intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence that is processed by machines. AI needs software that can comprehend what is happening 
                    within boundaries (Like input, criteria, and situation) it uses complex algorithms to learn from and use that knowledge in the future (Cote, 2021). 
                    Specific applications of AI in business can be implemented such as natural language processing for chatbots and customer service, recommendation systems 
                    for e-commerce, predictive analytics for demand forecasting, and computer vision for quality control. AI is a good way to improve your business’ value chain 
                    by analysing the outcome of projects.  
                    <span class="ReadMoreTxt">
                        <h2>Oganising within Your Business</h2>
                        AI processes a lot of data to extract valuable insights that can inform business decisions. By analysing historical data 
                        and real-time information, AI helps organizations make decisions based on evidence and trends rather than gut feelings or intuition (Allen, 2018). This will lead 
                        to more certain success due to the data gathered, and not possible failure due to gut feelings. From the outcome of the AI, people can then use their gut feelings 
                        without suffering dire consequences. People might offer good insights and experiences for their field, though it might be timely. AI systems can provide real-time 
                        decision support, aiding in fast-paced environments (Allen, 2018). For example, in financial trading, AI algorithms can make split-second decisions based on 
                        market data and trading patterns.<br><br>
                        <h2>You Still Need Human Labour</h2>
                        AI in the business world does not support overlooking the human aspect of a business, it will rather be used as a supporting role in a business. 
                        The information gathered has been done by humans to ensure correctness, completion and conformity to needs and expectations (Mallach, 2020). The importance 
                        of data quality and preprocessing in AI. AI systems heavily rely on clean and relevant data, and businesses need to invest in data preparation and quality 
                        assurance to maximize AI's effectiveness.<br><br>
                        <h2>You Can Create Your Own AI</h2>
                        Cost and time will be improved in the creation of the business’ service and products, human validation should still 
                        be involved in the creation process that ensures the service will be error-free and suitable for the user. AI allows for highly personalized marketing 
                        experiences. It can analyse individual preferences, past interactions, and browsing history to provide personalized product recommendations and content, 
                        enhancing customer engagement. AI in the workplace will fragment long-standing workflows, creating many human jobs to integrate those workflows.<br><br>
                        <h2>AI ensures Client Satisfaction</h2>
                        AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide 24/7 customer support, answer common queries, and guide customers through the buying process, improving customer 
                        service and user experience, or they can prolong the user until a human can assist them as soon as possible. AI will help the production and service businesses by
                        calculating the outcomes beforehand like; shipping date, package weight and shipping costs(low and effective).<br><br>
                        <h2>AI Improves The Game</h2>
                        E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the Internet. 
                        In e-commerce, AI can adjust pricing in real-time based on factors like demand, competitor pricing, and user behaviour, maximizing revenue and profitability. 
                        AI can recognise bots on social media and can ensure that there are no fraudulent leads (Allen, 2018).<br><br> 
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        In summary, AI enhances decision-making in business by providing data-driven insights, predictive and prescriptive analytics, automation of routine 
                        decisions, real-time support, risk management, customer insights, cost reduction, and competitive advantage. It contributes to more informed, efficient, 
                        and strategic decision-making processes, ultimately benefiting the business's overall performance and success. All of the actions conducted by AI must be 
                        overlooked by the people in the company to ensure that it is correct and fit for the purpose.<br><br>
