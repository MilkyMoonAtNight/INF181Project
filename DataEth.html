                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    Data ethics is described as an organisation’s use of their clients’ and workers’ personal information that is stored in a database. 
                    The organisation has a moral obligation when handling the entities of their database with care and privacy. The way they collect and delete 
                    the entities also falls under the umbrella of data ethics. We all know that good ethics of a company shines in the spotlight within a company. 
                    Bad use of ethics within a company leads to distrust in the community then leads to their downfall. There are legal and moral use of data-driven 
                    operations we will be discussing all the uses of data. <br><br>
                    <span class="ReadMoreTxt">
                        <h2>TheLegal Aspect:</h2>
                        The data you hold is more valuable than the service that keeps the company up and running, due to the laws protecting all entities. 
                        The POPI Act (Protection of Personal Information Act) in South Africa protects entities from data theft or data mishandling. 
                        “The POPIA sets out the regulations and laws relating to third parties involved in data processing, such as the collection, use, transfer, 
                        matching and storage of data”(Gazette, 2013).<br><br> 
                        <h2>Your Business' Success</h2>
                        We are living in a world where personal information is used everywhere, such as personalising 
                        content online requires oodles upon oodles of personal information. For example, if you create a Facebook account, they require you to fill in some 
                        personal information, that information is used to identify the account holder, and the interest of the account will lead to the content shown on the account. 
                        Data is an asset that can build the next great business or innovation to improve the lives of countless people. However, it is also a resource that 
                        many organizations are not protecting or using ethically which leads to their downfall.<br><br>
                        <h2>Trust Between Your Clients</h2>
                        Data ethics mainly focuses on the person’s moral code that may not apply to the POPI Act. Actions like withholding lethal data toward a company's success 
                        or downfall are seen as your moral compass being questioned for your benefit (Cote, 2021). Being asked by a person of authority to access data that you 
                        should not see while it is accessible to you is another violation of your moral code. If you share information about something or someone that should be 
                        kept redacted, that is unethical. These actions might not fall under the legal umbrella, but it is certainly unethical use of information 
                        (Luciano Floridi, 2016).<br><br>
                        <h2>How Should You Collect Information</h2>
                        Data ethics often emphasizes the importance of obtaining informed consent from individuals whose data is being collected and processed. 
                        It's not just about being transparent in what data is collected but also ensuring that individuals willingly provide their data with a clear understanding 
                        of how it will be used (Mike, 2022). Many corporations may bend the rules a little bit, for instance, the company will provide a terms and conditions 
                        contract that may be bombarded with unnecessary information that they know no one will read. However, the actual use of the information will be buried 
                        and overlooked in the contract, so it is considered to be legal. A key principle of data ethics is data minimization (NSHEngland, 2013).<br><br>
                        <h2>What Is Being Collected</h2>
                        This means collecting and retaining only the data that is necessary for a specific purpose. Organizations should avoid collecting excessive or irrelevant data. 
                        While there is no universally accepted approach for tackling data projects, whether they are large or of a different scale, the fundamental objective is to 
                        adapt fundamental human rights to the digital era (Mallach, 2020). Regardless of the terminology employed, the driving force behind these principles is the 
                        contemplation of potential harm to individuals, institutions, and systems. Data ethics also includes ensuring the security of the data collected. 
                        This involves protecting data from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks, and implementing security measures like encryption and access 
                        controls (NSHEngland, 2013).<br><br>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        Data ethics does not only apply to the data being stolen or misused it also involves the usage of data. Data should 
                        be used in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. This means avoiding bias and discrimination in data analysis and decision-making, which could 
                        disproportionately affect certain groups. Overall, data ethics goes beyond mere compliance with the law and extends into the realm of responsible and 
                        morally sound data handling practices. It involves considering the potential impacts of data use on individuals and society and making decisions that 
                        align with ethical principles.<br><br>
