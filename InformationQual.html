                                <h2>Introduction.</h2>
                                Information quality is a crucial component that determines the usefulness of information in enhancing the effectiveness 
                                of an operation. It is a measure of the accuracy, completeness, relevance, timeliness, and consistency 
                                of the information, which ultimately contributes to the value it adds to the operation. Therefore, high-quality 
                                information is essential for making informed decisions, improving productivity, reducing errors, and achieving organizational 
                                objectives.<br><br>

                                    <h2>DIMENSIONS OF INFORMATION QUALITY:</h2>
                                    To evaluate the quality of the information in a business, we need to consider various factors that makeup information 
                                    quality dimensions. These dimensions help us determine how good the information is and whether it can be relied upon.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><h4>ACCURACY.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            Accuracy is a measure of how close the actual value is to the perfectly calculated value (Mallach, 2020). 
                                            In other words, it is a means of determining how correct a prediction or estimate is. For instance, when forecasting 
                                            the weather, there may be variations in the predicted weather conditions and the actual weather. However, if the 
                                            variation is minimal, the prediction is considered to be accurate (Sarfin, 2022). Therefore, accuracy is not just 
                                            about being correct, but about how close the actual value is to the expected value.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>COMPLETENESS.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            Completeness refers to the degree to which all relevant information is included in the dataset, without any 
                                            significant gaps or omissions (Mallach, 2020). This is particularly important for businesses that rely on customer
                                             data to inform their marketing strategies and sales efforts, as incomplete information can lead to missed 
                                             opportunities and reduced profitability (Sarfin, 2022). For example, if a company's customer database is missing 
                                             key pieces of information such as demographic data or purchase history, it may be difficult to effectively target 
                                             marketing campaigns and tailor offers to specific customer segments. Ensuring data completeness requires careful 
                                            attention to data collection, storage, and management processes, as well as ongoing efforts to identify and 
                                            address any gaps or inconsistencies in the data.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>CONSISTENCY.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            Consistency refers to the uniformity of the data (Mallach, 2020). In other words, it ensures that all data 
                                            contributing to the same data item share the same assumptions, definitions, and time periods. Inconsistencies 
                                            in data can arise from various sources such as different units of measurement, data entry errors, and inconsistencies
                                             in data processing (Sarfin, 2022). For instance, if a company uses different units of measurement in different
                                              systems, such as kilometres in one system and miles in another, it could lead to erroneous analysis and decision-
                                            making. Therefore, ensuring consistency in data is critical for organizations to make informed decisions, prevent 
                                            errors, and maintain data integrity.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>TIMELINESS.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            The timeliness of information is crucial for making informed decisions. It encompasses three main aspects - 
                                            the time when the information is required, its availability, and the method of sourcing (Mallach, 2020). 
                                            The information must be up-to-date, relevant, and gathered on time so that it can be used effectively to make 
                                            informed decisions. For instance, if a company's competitor analysis data is not up-to-date or is sourced through 
                                            unreliable means, it may fail to respond effectively to competitive threats, leading to potential losses. Therefore, 
                                            it is imperative to ensure that the information is timely and reliable to make informed decisions and stay ahead of 
                                            the competition.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>PRECISION.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            Precision refers to the smallest discernible difference that can be represented by the data (Mallach, 2020). In simpler terms, precision is the smallest unit that can accurately represent the data. For instance, consider a scenario where an item costs R12,16. The sixteen cents in the price indicates the precision of the data. It is important to note that precision should never exceed accuracy, as this would lead to the delivery of misleading or incorrect information (Gupta, 2022). Therefore, when representing data, it is crucial to ensure that precision is kept in check and that it is commensurate with the accuracy of the data to avoid misinterpretation. 
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>COST.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            The cost refers to the value of all the resources used to gather the information, including both monetary expenses and time (Mallach, 2020). The cost can include the salaries of employees, the cost of software and hardware, and any other expenses that are incurred in the process of collecting and analysing data.
                                            To determine whether an information system is worth the investment, businesses need to compare the costs with the benefits (Mallach, 2020). By weighing the costs against the benefits, businesses can make informed decisions about whether to invest in an information system or not. This analysis can help to ensure that businesses are spending their resources wisely and making the most of their investments.

                                        <p>
                                            Data correctness refers to the accuracy and reliability of data and ensures that the information is generated from the appropriate data values without making any errors in the processing steps (Mallach, 2020). In some cases, data correctness can be absolute, such as a person's age or other personal details. However, for much numerical data, approximate values are considered acceptable, as they provide a close approximation of the actual value. It is important to ensure that the data is correct and reliable to avoid any incorrect conclusions or decisions based on inaccurate information. Therefore, data correctness should be a top priority when dealing with any kind of data.

                                        <p>
                                            Conformity to needs and expectations refers to the degree to which the process, timelines, and delivery match the specific requirements of the entity being served (Mallach, 2020). This involves a thorough understanding of the entity's needs and expectations, as well as the ability to tailor the process to meet those needs effectively. The process should be designed to be flexible and adaptable, ensuring that any changes or adjustments can be made quickly and efficiently. By conforming to the needs and expectations of the entity, the provider can ensure that they are meeting their obligations and delivering a high level of customer satisfaction.

                                <h2>DATA CLEANSING AND VALIDATION</h2>
                                Data cleansing is an essential process that involves identifying and rectifying any errors or inconsistencies in a database (Tableau, 2023). The errors may range from incorrect formatting, incomplete data, and duplicate entries, to even corrupted records. These issues can arise due to various reasons such as human error while entering data, merging of multiple data sources, or system glitches. It is crucial to clean the data to ensure that the information extracted from it is accurate and reliable, regardless of how well the algorithm or model performs. 
                                The process of data cleansing can be broken down into five essential steps that include...
                                <span class="ReadMoreTxt">
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><h4>STEP 1: REMOVE DUPLICATE OR IRRELEVANT OBSERVATIONS.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            When working with datasets, one of the first steps is to remove any unwanted or irrelevant observations (Tableau, 2023). This is particularly important to ensure that the data being analysed is accurate and representative of the problem that is being investigated. 
                                            One common issue that arises is the presence of duplicate observations. Duplicate data can enter a dataset in a variety of ways, such as during the data-capturing process (Tableau, 2023). Therefore, deduplication is a crucial step in cleaning the data. In addition to eliminating duplicate data, it is also important to identify and remove irrelevant observations. These are observations that do not fit into the specific problem or question that the dataset is being used to analyse. For instance, older data may become irrelevant and should be removed to improve the performance of analysis and minimize the distraction from the primary purpose. By removing unwanted and irrelevant observations, the resulting dataset will be more accurate and therefore produce more reliable insights and conclusions.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>STEP 2: FIX STRUCTURAL ERRORS.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            In data analysis, structural errors may occur due to inconsistencies in naming conventions, typos, or incorrect capitalization (Tableau, 2023). These errors are often detected during data measurement or transfer and can result in the misclassification of categories or classes. 
                                            For instance, the use of "N/A" and "Not Applicable" may refer to the same meaning, but they would be analysed as separate categories, leading to a skewed analysis or misinterpretation of results. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain consistency in naming conventions and ensure accuracy in data transfer to avoid such structural errors in data analysis.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>STEP 3: FILTER UNWANTED OUTLIERS.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            Data analysis involves working with large datasets that can sometimes contain observations that appear to not fit in with the rest of the data (Tableau, 2023). These observations are called outliers and can have a significant impact on the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data. Outliers can arise for various reasons such as improper data entry, measurement errors or due to the real-world phenomenon being studied.
                                            Removing unwanted outliers from the dataset can improve the accuracy of the analysis. However, the decision to remove outliers should be appropriately evaluated because outliers might sometimes prove the theory being worked on. It is important to note that not all outliers are incorrect and that removing them without thorough consideration can lead to biased results.
                                            Therefore, before removing outliers, it is necessary to determine if there is a legitimate reason to do so. This can be done by examining the source of the outlier, verifying the data, and assessing the impact it has on the overall analysis. In some cases, it might be necessary to keep outliers in the dataset to avoid losing valuable information that could be significant in confirming or disproving the theory being studied.
                                            Overall, it is critical to exercise caution when handling outliers and to ensure that any decisions made are based on thorough consideration, legitimate reasons, and a clear understanding of the impact on the overall analysis.
                                        </p>
                                        <li><h4>STEP 4: HANDLE MISSING DATA.</h4></li>
                                        <p>
                                            When data is incomplete, it presents a significant challenge to data analysis, as many statistical algorithms require complete data to function (Tableau, 2023). To overcome this issue, there are several options available, but each of them has its limitations.
                                            One approach is to discard any observations that have missing data. However, this method may result in the loss of important information, so it must be considered carefully. The advantage of this method is that it allows for the analysis of complete data sets, with no missing values. However, this approach may not be practical in situations where a substantial amount of data is missing.
                                            Another option is to fill in the missing values based on other observations. This approach can be effective, but it is still subject to assumptions, and the integrity of the data can be compromised. It is important to note that the accuracy of the analysis will depend on the quality of the assumptions made.
                                            The third option is to alter the method used to analyse the data to work around the missing data. However, this approach is only feasible if the amount of missing data is small.
                                            In summary, dealing with missing data is a complex issue, and it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option carefully.

                                            It is important to test your dataset at the end of the cleansing process by answering a few questions that aim to assess the integrity of the dataset.
                                            Does the data make sense?
                                            Does the data follow the appropriate rules for its field?
                                            Does it prove or disprove your working theory, or bring any insight to light?
                                            Can you find trends in the data to help you form your next theory?
                                            If not, is that because of a data quality issue?

                                            Making decisions based on incorrect or dirty data can lead to faulty conclusions and poor business strategies. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly examine and analyse the data before drawing any conclusions.
