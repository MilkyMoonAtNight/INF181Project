                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            Data Visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data and information to help people better understand complex concepts. This involves using various tools such as graphs, charts, and maps to display patterns and trends in data. (Tableau, 2023)
                            Using data visualisation techniques, decision-makers can easily comprehend vast amounts of information, identify key insights and trends, and make data-driven decisions. Its importance in the business world cannot be overstated as it provides a straightforward way to convey complex information and enables analysts to identify patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.

                                <h2>TYPES OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS:</h2>
                                There are several types of data visualization, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Below are a few examples:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><h4>BAR CHARTS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Bar charts are a popular type of graph used to visually compare the values of different categories. They are commonly used in business, finance, and other fields where data analysis is important. One of the key benefits of bar charts is their ease of use - they are simple to read and understand (Hillier, 2021).
                                        Bar charts can be displayed horizontally or vertically and can also be used to track changes over time, making them useful for identifying patterns and trends (Velarde, 2021). This feature allows users to see how values have changed over time, which can be valuable when making decisions or planning (Hillier, 2021).
                                        However, it is important to note that bar charts can become cluttered and difficult to read if there are too many bars. This is something to keep in mind when creating a chart, as it can impact the effectiveness of the visualization. Overall, bar charts are a powerful tool for data analysis, but should be used carefully to ensure that they are easy to read and understand (Hillier, 2021).
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="BarChart.jpg" class="datavirtual">
                                    <li><h4>LINE GRAPHS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Line graphs are a commonly used method for visually representing time series data. They are particularly useful in identifying trends, accelerations, decelerations, and volatility within the dataset. The graph consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis, with each data point being plotted at its corresponding x and y values. By using multiple lines on the same graph, different datasets can be compared, and correlations can be identified (Hillier, 2021).
                                        However, it's important to note that line graphs can be misleading if the y-axis does not start at zero. This can exaggerate the differences between data points and lead to incorrect interpretations of the trend. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that the scale on the y-axis is appropriate and accurately reflects the data being presented (Hillier, 2021).
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="LineGraph.png" class="datavirtual">
                                    <li><h4>PIE CHARTS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Pie charts are circular graphs that are used to represent the distribution of data within a single category. Each slice of the pie chart is proportional to the contribution of that category to the whole, making it a great tool for displaying percentages of data (Hillier, 2021). However, it is important to note that pie charts can become difficult to read when there are too many slices or if the slices are of the same size. Therefore, it is recommended to use pie charts when there are a limited number of categories and the differences in their contributions are significant enough to be easily discernible (Velarde, 2021).
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="PieChart.png" class="datavirtual">
                                    <li><h4>HEATMAPS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Heatmaps are a popular data visualization tool that uses a colour-coded scheme to represent data values in a two-dimensional image. Heatmaps can be used to track user interactions on a website and analyse how visitors engage with different elements of the site (Hotjar, 2023). In epidemiology, they are useful for analysing the spread of a virus and identifying hotspots of infection (Wilcox, 2020).
                                        However, it is crucial to choose an appropriate colour scale to ensure an accurate interpretation of the data (Hotjar, 2023). The choice of colour scale can significantly affect the visibility of patterns, and an inappropriate colour scheme can lead to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is essential to choose a colour scheme that is suitable for the type of data being analysed and provides clear and precise insights.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="HeatMaps.jpg" class="datavirtual">
                                    <li><h4>SCATTER PLOTS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Scatter plots are graphs that use dots to represent the intersection of two values on the x and y-axis (Hillier, 2021); (Velarde, 2021). When there is more than one data set, the dots are of different colours. These graphs are used to analyse the correlation between variables. If there is a third interrelated data point, a 3D scatterplot can be used. Scatter plots are useful for showing relationships between variables, but they can be difficult to interpret with large amounts of data.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="ScatterGraph.png" class="datavirtual">
                                    <li><h4>HISTOGRAMS.</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Histograms are a type of chart that is used to visually represent the distribution of numeric data (Hillier, 2021). They are like bar charts, but instead of showing the frequency of categorical data, histograms represent the number of data points that fall within specific ranges. This makes them an excellent tool for summarizing large data sets and identifying patterns or trends in the data.
                                        However, it's important to select the range carefully when creating a histogram, as an incorrect range could lead to a misleading interpretation of the data.

                                    <li><h4>SIMPLICITY</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Simplicity is the key to effective data visualization. The goal is to simplify complex data sets and make them understandable to the audience (GoBeyond, 2019). This requires selecting the appropriate visual format for the intended audience, keeping visuals simple and easy to understand, and avoiding clutter and unnecessary visual elements (Mahler, 2023).
                                    </p>
                                    <li><h4>ACCURACY</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        In order to prevent any misinterpretation, it is essential to maintain a high level of accuracy when presenting data (Neve, 2018). The use of precise and up-to-date information is critical to ensure that the data is represented honestly and without any bias. Additionally, it is important to carefully analyse any data to identify any potential errors or inconsistencies that may affect the accuracy of the final result. By taking these steps, we can ensure that the information we present is reliable, and trustworthy, and provides valuable insights to those who rely on it.
                                    </p>
                                    <li><h4>RELEVANCE</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        Relevance is essential to ensure that the data visualized is meaningful to the audience and context (Mahler, 2023). This involves having a clear goal that people care about, focusing on key areas, and using patterns, comparing parameters, and creating interactivity.
                                    </p>
                                    <li><h4>BEST PRACTICES</h4></li>
                                    <p>
                                        To follow best practices, select the right visualization tool, use clear and concise labels and titles, and choose appropriate colours (GoBeyond, 2019). Additionally, incorporating interactivity can make your graphs or charts more engaging. Always remember to document your charts with appropriate labels, scales, and data sources.
